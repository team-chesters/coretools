* Easy Data Type Conversion
* Reduces development hassle
* Lightweight and fast

* Increase reusability
* Be clean & readable
* Be easy to debug
* Be maintainable
* Be modular
* Have unit tests for all modules
* Work on multiple environments (IE11+ with Modern Browser)
* Be compatible with other frameworks or libraries
