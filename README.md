# Makeasy.js

Makeasy.js is functional utility library for JavaScript, inspired by [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) and my work experience. Makeasy is pronounced [mek-ˈiːzi].

## Why Makeasy?
* Easy Data Type Conversion
* Reduces hassle
* ~~maybe add more in future~~

## Makeasy should
* be increase reuse.
* be clean & readable.
* be debug.
* be maintain.
* be modular.
* has unit tests for all modules.
* work on multiple environments. (IE11+ w/ Modern Browser)
* be compatible with other framework or library. (possible should)

## Makeasy shouldn't be
* UI Components.
* CSS Selector Engine or simliar code.
* Template Engine
* Anything that could be separate libraries.
* Anything that isn't modular libraries.
